Implicit Persistence User Preferences System
--------------------------------------------

My SQL Data Browser stores information about the user's latest
activity in the database and restores it as needed upon logon.

The information is stored in the user's logon table msdb_passwd.

The name of the database last used, the table last viewed, the last
selection criteria, the sort order, and the last row touched are stored.

When the user next logs on, My SQL Data Browser will show the last set of rows
viewed by the user. If the last row touched is in this set, it is highlighted.
