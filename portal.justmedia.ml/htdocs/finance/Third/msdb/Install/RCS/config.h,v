Configuration Help
------------------

It is possible that the configuration of My SQL Data Browser was not performed
or is incorrect. If so, here are some instructions:

Edit the file

	config.php


Set the mysql User and Password.


$msdbConfig['DB_USER'] = 'msdb' ;
$msdbConfig['DB_PW'] = 'msdb' ;


Set the database where msdb is to hold user authentication information.

$msdbConfig['DB_NAME'] = 'msdb' ;


Once this is done, you will be prompted for permission to create
two tables in it the database.
	msdb_passwd - a list of users
	msdb_permit - access permissions

My SQL Data Browser will only allow login to users according to the
authentication information in msdb_passwd.

My SQL Data Browser will only browse This database,
having the table msdb_permit in it.
